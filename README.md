# Tic-Tac-Toe

TicTacToe is a classic game played by two players, X and O, on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to place three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player who successfully completes this first, wins the game.

In this online version of TicTacToe, players have the option to play a multiplayer game. The game board is displayed on the screen and players can place their symbols by clicking on the desired square.

Overall, TicTacToe is a fun and easy-to-play game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. Whether you're looking for a quick game during your lunch break or a friendly competition with friends and family, TicTacToe is the perfect choice.
